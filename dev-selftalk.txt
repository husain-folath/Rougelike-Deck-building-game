roguelike deck builder game

/*
Game
The game should be available in different difficulties such as (easy, normal, hard).
Showcase how the difficulties change the gaming experience.
The player can choice the difficulty of the AI
Should have a button (How to play) to explain how to play.
The difficulty may change the damage or cost or effect of a card.

Card(s)
I can use the cards as an array of objects. 
Example: let Cards=[card1, card2, card3]
Each card would usually consist of ID, name, cost, effect (which may be damage or healing or shielding), description, image.
Example: let card={ID:1,name: ”Enchanting blood”,cost:3, effect: nextDamage*2, description:” doubles the next instance of damage.”,  img: “url”}
Once the player loses, they should not be able to perform turn/actions
Player
The player will have a dynamic health bar. It should decrease as it receives damage and increase as it is healed
The play will lose if their health becomes 0 or less.
It should display a health of 0 at least

PVE/ Enemy
Enemies cards are cards possessed by the computer.
Enemies might be created similarly to cards
Enemies cards might have attributes ID, name, Deck, health,image
Example: let enemies=[enemy1, enemy2, enemy3]
Let Enemy={ID:1, name: ”John Cena”, Deck:[1,2,3], img: “url”}

Most likely I will implement fundamentally simple enemy AI
